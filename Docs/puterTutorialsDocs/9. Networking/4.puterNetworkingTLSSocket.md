# TLSSocket
* * *

The TLS Socket API lets you create a TLS protected TCP socket connection which can be used directly in the browser. The interface is exactly the same as the normal [`puter.net.Socket`](https://docs.puter.com/Networking/Socket/) but connections are encrypted instead of being in plain text.

[](#syntax)Syntax
-----------------

```
const socket = new puter.net.tls.TLSSocket(hostname, port)

```


[](#parameters)Parameters
-------------------------

#### [](#-code-hostname-code-string-required-)`hostname` (String) (Required)

The hostname of the server to connect to. This can be an IP address or a domain name.

#### [](#-code-port-code-number-required-)`port` (Number) (Required)

The port number to connect to on the server.

[](#return-value)Return value
-----------------------------

A `TLSSocket` object.

[](#methods)Methods

*   `open` - The socket is open.
*   `data` - Data is received from the socket.
*   `error` - An error occurs on the socket.

#### [](#-code-socket-write-data-code-)`socket.write(data)`

Write data to the socket.

### [](#parameters)Parameters

*   `data` (String) The data to write to the socket.
